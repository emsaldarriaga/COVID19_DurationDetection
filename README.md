# COVID19_DurationDetection
The objective is to estimate the mean duration of the detectable period for the SARS-CoV-2 virus from samples taken from the Upper and Lower respiratory tracts. I use a random-effect meta-analysis model to estimate the pooled mean and prediction intervals from single-mean studies.
